## Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: All 7 standard Tetromino pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- **Colorful Design**: Each block type has unique gradient colors with glowing shadow effects
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive keyboard controls with smooth piece movement
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game speed increases as you level up
- **Score System**: Points awarded for clearing lines (more lines = more points)
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time tracking of score, lines cleared, level, and play time
- **Next Piece Preview**: See what's coming next to plan your strategy
- **Pause/Resume**: Take a break anytime with the pause feature

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **A** | Move piece left |
| **D** | Move piece right |
| **S** | Speed drop (hold for fast falling) |
| **W** | Rotate piece clockwise |
| **P** | Pause/Resume game |

## How to Play

1. Pieces fall from the top of the board
2. Use **A** and **D** to position pieces horizontally
3. Press **W** to rotate pieces
4. Hold **S** to make pieces fall faster
5. Complete horizontal lines to clear them and score points
6. Game ends when pieces stack to the top

## Scoring

- **1 Line**: 100 points √ó level
- **2 Lines**: 300 points √ó level
- **3 Lines**: 500 points √ó level
- **4 Lines (Tetris)**: 800 points √ó level

## Level Progression

- Level increases every 10 lines cleared
- Higher levels = faster falling speed
- Maximum challenge at higher levels!

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - UI library with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful UI components
